# Things to do for Oddmuse 6

Code Review:

- attach documentation to elements using #|{...}
- remove spaces betwen function name and argument list in declarations
- avoid sub forms of grep and map
- use colon notation, e.g. @results.push($change) â†’ @results.push: $change
- avoid open and use the IO layer in Storage::File
- use $dir.add: 'rc.log' instead of "$dir/rc.log" and the like
- use more statement modifiers if the block is only one line
- get rid of id => $id and the like: use :$id instead
- something like %context<pages> = 'id' X=> @pages; in Layout.pm6

Debt:

- abstract the layout using a standard header and footer
- change all the calls from Storage.new to Storage.get which return a
  singleton

Missing features:

- unified layout
- merge in case of conflicts
- expiration of old page revisions
- admin passwords
- page passwords
- locking the site
- locking pages
- banning regular expressions
- question asking for first time posters
- rolling back changes
- RSS feed
- tags
- search
- comments
- image upload
- better HTML caching
- better HTTP caching (Etags, 304)

Missing big ideas:

- a plugin system
- markup rules which users can add, ideally by merging grammars (this
  enables us to have rules that protect text from further processing,
  such as code blocks; this requires the notion of rule precedence)
- a backend implementation using SQLite
